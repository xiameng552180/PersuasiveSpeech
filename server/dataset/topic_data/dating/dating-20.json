      "op_premise": "[I once had a conversation with a friend that went something like:, Me: She\\s pretty hot, but I don\\t think she has a fuck buddy right now., Him: No, fuck that. A girl that hot can\\t not be fucking someone regularly, For some reason, this conversation has stuck with me. I only ever had one girlfriend for 8 months during my freshman year of college. Now, as a senior in college, I had only had a couple drunk hookups since then., My parents awkwardly said to me one day, You know, fourth_alternate, we realized you hadn\\t dated anyone since freshman year. I highly recommend you give online dating a try. This frustrated me. Now my parents didn\\t even believe in me to try to start a relationship the real way. I had always equated online dating with giving up, Now, I thought that people give up for three reasons:, They are too unattractive to have the confidence to try to get a date in the real world, They are too awkward in the real world, They have some sort of crazy personality flaw that one could easily recognize in the real world, but not online., In my mind, there is no reason why a sane, somewhat attractive woman (both physically and psychologically) would not be able to find a date in real life, and would have to resort to online dating. It makes no fucking sense to me. CMV., EDIT: Wow. All these responses were amazing and well thought-out. I guess the only way to really is to try it myself. For now, consider me. I would award it to a specific person, but everyone who responded had very unique, yet solid points to make. Thanks everyone! I do have some... err... unconventional views about things, but I will always come here in the future if I want someone to C my V!]",

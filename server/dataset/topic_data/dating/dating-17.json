{"dating-17": [{"op_claim": "I believe dating is unequal and heavily favors women. CMV", "op_premise": "[I was previously ignorant of gender inequalities and relations and after reading a ton of r/askwomen, r/askmen, r/datingadvice, and r/relationships in the past couple months I fear I have grown to hate women, or at least their modern behavior and social roles., I dont want to feel this way because I cant just hate 3.5 billion people but when it comes to the dating world I feel quite jaded by the endeavour., So, if, for example, I meet a women and wish to pursue a relationship with her, I have to make the first move. Then, should the women choose to accept me, I have to offer a date place and time. Then, in most situations, I have to pay because it was my idea and it would be rude to ask someone to pay for something I invited them to. The money isnt that big of a deal though and feminists usually offer to go dutch so thats nice., After that, Im expected to call and say it was fun, and then plan the next date. During the dates I often feel like I have to carry the conversation because a lot of women are shy so I have to ask questions about their lives while strategically inserting information regarding myself every once in a while so the conversation doesnt feel so one-sided., After that, if we want to move to sex, I have to initiate. Then the performance begins. I have gently kiss her, move my lips down to her neck, giving attention to all parts of her body, caressing her, massaging her, and providing ample foreplay. Then, after enough aussies, she is thoroughly relaxed and penetration can begin. Thus begins a half an hour of tiring cycling of positions of thrusting while she just sits there and maybe moans every now and again. I barely even enjoy myself and she has multiple orgasms., I dont understand how so many women can say theyll break up with a partner if they dont go down on them. Women expect men to do all the work in the bed (overwhelmingly they prefer a dominant partner) yet when it also benefits them for their man to be temporarily submissive by performing cunninglingus it is required. Instead of saying you want a dominant partner why not just say you want one that does all the work? If a women is submissive and a man dominant in a relationship, I think its completely equal if the man recieves oral and the woman doesnt. Obviously if the man likes giving oral thats his prerogative but I reject reddits consensus that a man not reciprocating oral with oral is somehow unfair, like all other acts in and out of the bedroom mean nothing., Another thing that bothers me is when women say they just wanted to be treated like a person, or how we treat other guys. No you dont. I have tried this and it does not work. Men are vulgar to each other and fight. My friends and I constantly talk shit on each other and jokingly reinforce every stereotype when were doing a commentary on shows were watching, for example., Men have to constantly censor themselves and their behavior when trying to get with a women. That\\s why you feel like you are objectified, because you are. I, and most men, cannot act like I do around my friends as I do you because you would be repulsed. You know how when women have a problem they want empathy, reassurance, compassion, and the such from their boyfriend? I\\m listening to you and your problems and just cycling through I\\m sorry to hear that, I can\\t imagine how hard that must be for you, and Let me know if I could do anything to help. If a guy friend came to me with a problem I treat him like a person and we try to collaborate to fix it. If you want to be egalitarian you need to be it on all fronts, and not only on ones that benefit women., Men in general do not feel desired by women. Men buy the gifts, make the dates, and put themselves out there while the women, from her pedestal, wish men would stop putting her on pedestals. We have to constantly reassure you that youre beautiful, not fat, not crazy, etc. while all of mens emotions are completely ignored for that of the womens. Women get annoyed by physical compliments while most men have never even been complimented or can at least count on one hand the amount of times. Even in a relationship it often feels like youre not even physically attracted to us but just likes what we can do for you., Anyways, by now you must think Im some old MRA, bitter, and alone. Im actually 20 and have pretty much kept all of this in my head and never let in manifest in any way. I try to be a good person and have had great and fulfilling relationships. Dont think Im also not aware of the problems women face and how they are discriminated against. Im aware many can only get off through clitoral stimulation, that they are only viewed as sexual creatures and seldom seen for their intelligence, and preyed against sexually, in the workplace, and society. I feel such cognitive dissonance because gender relations are so complicated and changing every day and there is so much inequality and discrimination on both sides that Im aware of that its hard to just shut off and recognize most people try to be good. I just really hate how disproportioned it seems to be in the dating world., TL;DR: Dating and relationships favor women.]", "reply-info": [{"replyer_name": "Imwe", "reply_time": "7 years ago",

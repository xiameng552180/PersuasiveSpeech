Chances are someone is going to have an affair, children can easily pick up on parents in an unhappy relationship.\", \"Children tend to model their relationships based on the relationship of their parents. Having parents that never hug or kiss or show affection to each other isn't ideal either.\", \"A better solution is to get a divorce, learn to co-parent. You don't have to have sex with someone to raise a kid with them. It shows a better model that your parents were unhappy, they get a divorce, are able to co-parents effectively and maybe find a separate relationship which doesn't affect the love between the parent and child. How is this not more effective than two people forced to compromise and live together and their kids can see right through it.\", 'how many of you knew your parents were simply staying together for the kids, do you think that worked for you?', 'Change my muthafucking view'",

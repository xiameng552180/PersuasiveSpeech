Who has a greater impact on the mental and physical well-being of a child?', \"Shitty people aren't born, they are raised by shitty parents.

You would create a much more well-adjusted population with less of a propensity for violence and hate.', 'CMV', 'UPDATE', 'Thanks for all of the GREAT questions! A few answers:', \"Q. Aren't you talking about eugenics?\", 'Absolutely not. Eugenics is the attempt to create a better race of humans through genetics. It involves only allowing certain people with preferred traits to reproduce. I am NOT saying that anyone\\'s ability to have kids would be infringed upon- only their ability to raise kids. \"Nurture\" instead of \"Nature\".', 'Q. Who writes the test/course? What is in it? Is it hard to pass? Who grades it?', 'Fantastic question that raises lots of interesting subplots. Do you create national standards- or should it me a more regional or local thing? Both have pros and cons. If you go national, do you have to dumb it down to the point that is serves no purpose? If you go regional or local, will you have people wanting to move to AL because they have easier tests? Will certain areas use this for political or religious gain?', \"In short- I don't know- but I am open to debate on all possible solutions and outcomes.\", 'Q. What if you are already a parent?', 'I would think there could be certain folks who could be grandfathered in, just like all new laws.', 'Q. What is actually IN the course/test?', 'I envision it as a parental version of \"Driver\\'s Ed\". Basic skills (feeding, changing, bathing, putting to bed, etc), health and hygiene (choosing a doc, common ailments and remedies, shot schedule, ect.), Parenting Styles, development stages, tips on how to deal with stress, etc. I would also see it as more of a \"certificate of completion\" instead of a \"test\" that had to be scored. Again- open to debate on this.', \"I fully understand that you can't force someone to use any of the info from the course- much in the same way as driver's ed- but I believe that parents have an inherent desire for their child's well-being. What they often lack is the situation awareness or the knowledge and emotional intelligence to deal with stressful situations.\"]",

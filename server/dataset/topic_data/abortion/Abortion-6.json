I support a woman\\s right to choose, but I think the sooner the abortion happens, the better. In cases where the mother\\s life is in danger, I absolutely support late-term abortions. I understand that the \"20 week rule\" could be a step towards outlawing abortion and overturning Roe v. Wade, so I don\\t want to hear a slippery-slope argument. I want to judge the 20 week rule on its own.]",

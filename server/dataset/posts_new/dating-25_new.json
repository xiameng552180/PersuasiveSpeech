Not directly because theyre black, but because I dont find them attractive. I find plenty of other minorities attractive, and I have black friends (but lets face it, every closet racist says that)., I dont believe I am racist. Its not a conscious decision to find black people unattractive, I just do. I believe that I am not racist in the same way that a straight person is not sexist to find other members of the same sex unattractive., CMV!, Sorry if any of my terminology was non-PC.]",

      "op_premise": "[I believe that people who say that they dont want to live forever are just comforting themselves with fake reasons to accept the inevitability of death. As a result of this we have too much acceptance of death and spend too little effort on life extension and eventual immortality., Some clarifications below., By immortality here I mean not dying from illnesses or old age., And I mean neither eternal youth nor chained to bed on life support., UPD, Common arguments put forth in this thread and some responses to them:, Death makes you live life to the fullest. See this thread. Also: this is the kind of argument like Without religion to guide them people would descend into sin or You cannot be truly happy until you have experienced true despair or Without masters, slaves would just roam aimlessly and die from depression. In other words: bullshit. If you want to live your life to the fullest, go and do it., Overpopulation and other ecological concerns. We will manage. Remeber that story about Manhattan and horse manure?, You will get bored. With every year of your life you discover new ways to entertain yourself, and the old ones dont go anywhere. Life is infinitely variable, and saying that youll explore it all by the time youre 80 or 800 or 8000 is very nearsighted., I will stop wanting to live eventually. See this thread., I will reformat the section above and add more links later.]",

If there is one, please explain., \"I find the violinist argument of Judith Jarvis Thompson to be unpersuasive: I think that the right of the violinist to life certainly trumps the right to not have ones body used by the violinist. If you wish to use some version of the argument, explain to me why the latter right trumps the former. For those unfamiliar with the argument:\", http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Defense_of_Abortion, \"Thank you for participating. This is basically the only issue where I part ways with my fellow progressives, and I would like to see r/changemyviews take.\", Edit: A third element I failed to include that is present in \"A Defense of Abortion\". Although the fetus may only be a clump of non-sentient cells, there is a fundamental difference between it and an amoeba or tree leaf cell: it\\s in the process of becoming sentient unless we actively move to stop it. So I view it as akin to someone who does have brain damage or something equivalent, but is improving and will be aware in nine months. Just like I think it would be murder to take that person off life support, the same applies in the case of a fetus. Here\\s the appropriate portion from \"A Defense of Abortion\":, \"<You wake up in the morning and find yourself back to back in bed with an unconscious violinist. A famous unconscious violinist. He has been found to have a fatal kidney ailment, and the Society of Music Lovers has canvassed all the available medical records and found that you alone have the right blood type to help. They have therefore kidnapped you, and last night the violinists circulatory system was plugged into yours, so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own. [If he is unplugged from you now, he will die; but] in nine months he will have recovered from his ailment, and can safely be unplugged from you.>\"]",

The world would be more peaceful and a much better place to live than it is today. Movies like Gattaca show a possibility of having superior being living alongside inferior but I think that natural birth should become illegal and babies can only be created using eugenics. I know this would be hard to do but families should really think before having natural birth when Eugenics is available considering their child would have a much lesser life. Eventually I think that the world would only exist of superior beings capable of solving many crisis' and protecting our race.\"]",

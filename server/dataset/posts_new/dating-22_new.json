      "op_claim": "I believe the unwillingness to date other races is not a personal preference, but is racist/prejudice. CMV",
      "op_premise": "[Specifically, I see alot if this in dating websites when in the description it may say something like whites only or no blacks. I\\ve ever seen on here that many people defend these actions because it isn\\t an act of racism, but an act of personal preference. I believe a preference is something that you would prefer, but not necessarily need. For example, I prefer long hair on girls I date, but I don\\t completely eliminate every short haired girl in my dating pool. Eliminating every single non-white person without so much giving them a chance to introduce themselves shows blatant racism in my eyes., In addition, I see people defend this by stating they can\\t help what they\\re attracted to, but I still don\\t see that as a real arguement. A better description would be I\\m mostly attracted to my own race, so farewarning, rather than no black people. One statement states you\\re most attracted to your own race, while the other blatantly eliminates an entire group of people without there being a remote close of a chance., I believe there could be many potential deal breakers a person could have, but having one based on ones skin color is racist. Please change my view., Edit- theres a really good discussion here guys. I (now) dont think saying racist was a good way to describe it (that view wasnt really changed due to a single comment, but rather multiple, so I award no deltas so far, mostly because my entire view hasnt changed, but a certain aspect), but I still feel a person has to have prejudice against a race to not even consider dating them., Edit #2- Many people have made great arguments here and Im sorry I couldnt address all of you; I had no idea there would be so many responses. While my view hasnt been completely changed, it certainly has given me a lot to think about, and ill even go as far to say as its not a racist act, for a good portion of people, at all bit rather a preference. However I still do feel its a bit prejudice to some extent to not give a race a chance. Thanks for letting me see the opposing arguments!]",

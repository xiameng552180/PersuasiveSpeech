      "op_premise": "[Hello their! I am a 15 year old, agnostic male. I went to a private middle and high school, and every year we learned about abortion., I first though abortion was a womans choice, that she can choice to bring a child into this life or not. But, I heard a great argument against this., The argument is known as the SLED argument., Their are only 4 things different from a unborn baby, and a human. These four things are Size, Level of development, environment, and dependency., Is it ok to kill a child, because it is smaller than you?, Is it ok to kill a baby because it dependns on you?, Is it ok to kill someone in a different envioment?, And is it ok to kill someone that is dependent on others?, Now, I know this is a opposing view from the majoirty of the people here. I wonder why people are so ok with just killing someone that hasent had a choice themselves. The child cant choose for themselves., In cases of rape, abortion is still wrong. Why should the child pay for another persons crime?, The only case that abortion is \"ok\" is when both the baby and mother will die in childbirth., CMV., Edit: wow, this blew up. My view has been changed, I never thought that I would see it this way., Thanks all!]",

      "op_premise": "[It is my belief that marriage is inherently a contract between two individuals (or more) that states that the parties involved are knowingly in love with each other and are willingly and voluntarily entering an arrangement to share property with each other., This holds true no matter how many are in the party or what composes the party., I also hold the beleif that marriage is a private institution that shouldnt be regulated or sanctioned by any form of government, no matter how big or small., I came to hold this belief after meeting a polygamist family that wasnt allowed to marry because of state law. It opened my eyes to the fact that I really didnt give two shits if these people wanted to get married. They seemed like normal people who just preferred something different to me. I see that kind of thing everyday., I quite literally equated it to choosing between a mustard hot dog or a ketchup hot dog., Its a pretty simple justification, really., Im open to having my views changed if the arguments are thorough and logical enough.]",

{"Abortion-13": [{"op_claim": "I think the abortion debate focuses too much on womens rights, and not enough on fetal rights CMV", "op_premise": "[\"I believe that the real question when debating abortion is at what point does the fetus have rights (ie to not be aborted). Any discussion before establishing this is idiotic in my opinion. Of course, if the fetus doesnt have any rights the women should be able to get an abortion! Its their body they should be in control of their health.\", Therefore, i believe that all this talk about \"women\\s rights\" really misses the point. Both sides should be defending why/why not, at a certain point in gestation, a fetus does or does not have rights. Simply saying \"its the woman\\s body she should be able to do what she wants\" does not acknowledge the fact that at some point the rights of the fetus needs to be taken into account. And where that point is, is actually the crux of the debate., \"Note: Im very pro womens health, and womens rights. I just believe that the debate isnt really a matter of womens rights, its a matter of at what point does the fetus have rights.\", \"Edit: Im talking about elective abortion\"]", "reply-info":

{"Marriage-51": [{"op_claim": "I dont think an atheist and a religious person could realistically have a good marriage, CMV.", "op_premise": "[When it comes down to marriage I think compatibility is key. In my experience when youre living with someone intimately, having the same or similar religious beliefs is immensely important. Because I believe that deep down they will always hope for you to convert and probably thinking you will see the light someday. The atheist will also hope deep down that they will lose their faith as well. Having this kind of thinking will make it irksome for both parties in the long run. In the event of an heated argument you can bet their faith or lack of to be brought up as an innate fault within themselves., In the end it will always be a nagging feeling because they will want to become one with each other and thats impossible when two people share different beliefs on something crucial to peoples lives as religion. That nagging feeling will naturally grow into contempt and tear the marriage apart., Edit: Let me be frank Im an American and I know little to zilch about how other countries handle religion, which could be my inherent failure of understanding some of the viewpoints you guys posted. Examples of working couples that have managed this can help. Because I never in my life have seen it and always felt a great deal of animosity for being an atheist in my life., To make some clarifications Im not talking about fundamentalist or militant atheist believe or not there is really a middle in between those two extremes. Big beliefs like religion which is large part of someones thinking and world view cannot be easily accepted by someone who does share similar beliefs., To specify Im only talking about religions such as Christianity, Islam, and Jadaism. Basically religions that take a big part of someones life and a major part of their worldview., Double edit: My original baseless assertion that it was impossible to have a good marriage was, admittedly, stupid.

It opened my eyes to the fact that I really didnt give two shits if these people wanted to get married. They seemed like normal people who just preferred something different to me. I see that kind of thing everyday., I quite literally equated it to choosing between a mustard hot dog or a ketchup hot dog., Its a pretty simple justification, really., Im open to having my views changed if the arguments are thorough and logical enough.]", "reply-info": [{"replyer_name": "ulyssessword", "reply_time": "6 years ago", "reply_delta_num": "15", "reply_votes": "3 points", "reply_contents": [{"content": "What about all of the legal benefits of marriage", "is_claim": "0", "claim_type": "0", "logos": "0", "pathos": "0", "evidence": "1", "relevance": "0", "ethos": "0", "concreteness": "0", "eloquence": "0"}, {"content": " Should income splitting be allowed between 3 (or 50) people", "is_claim": "0", "claim_type": "0", "logos": "0", "pathos": "0", "evidence": "1", "relevance": "0", "ethos": "0", "concreteness": "0", "eloquence": "0"}, {"content": " What about parental leave when a child is born into the family", "is_claim": "0", "claim_type": "0", "logos": "0", "pathos": "0", "evidence": "1", "relevance": "0", "ethos": "0", "concreteness": "0", "eloquence": "0"}, {"content": " With more than one wife, there is the potential to abuse paternity leave to get near perpetual time off", "is_claim": "0", "claim_type": "0", "logos": "1", "pathos": "0", "evidence": "1", "relevance": "0", "ethos": "0", "concreteness": "0", "eloquence": "0"}, {"content": " Benefits and other things that are given to someone\\s immediate family make the assumption that that will be about 3 people, and polygamy can throw that off by a huge amount", "is_claim": "0", "claim_type": "0", "logos": "1", "pathos": "0", "evidence": "1", "relevance": "0", "ethos": "0", "concreteness": "0", "eloquence": "0"}, {"content": " Im sure that there are many other things that are based on marriages and traditional families as well", "is_claim": "1", "claim_type": "initerpretation", "logos": "0", "pathos": "0", "evidence": "0", "relevance": "0", "ethos": "0", "concreteness": "0", "eloquence": "0"}, {"content": "TL;DR: there are too many things built around the idea of a nuclear family with two parents to make the change practical", "is_claim": "1", "claim_type": "initerpretation", "logos": "0", "pathos": "0", "evidence": "0", "relevance": "0", "ethos": "0", "concreteness": "0", "eloquence": "0"}, {"content": "4", "is_claim": "0", "claim_type": "0", "logos": "0", "pathos": "0", "evidence": "0", "relevance": "0", "ethos": "0", "concreteness": "0", "eloquence": "0"}]}, {"replyer_name": "anonoman925", "reply_time": "6 years ago", "reply_delta_num": "32", "reply_votes": "4 points", "reply_contents": [{"content": "Like you said its about the contract", "is_claim": "0", "claim_type": "0", "logos": "0", "pathos": "0", "evidence": "0", "relevance": "0", "ethos": "0", "concreteness": "0", "eloquence": "0"}, {"content": " When I got married I agreed to combine my property with my SO", "is_claim": "0", "claim_type": "0", "logos": "0", "pathos": "0", "evidence": "0", "relevance": "0", "ethos": "0", "concreteness": "0", "eloquence": "0"}, {"content": " Well, how does it work with a polygamist family", "is_claim": "1", "claim_type": "evaluation", "logos": "0", "pathos": "0", "evidence": "0", "relevance": "0", "ethos": "0", "concreteness": "0", "eloquence": "0"}, {"content": " Two is bad enough, for the courts", "is_claim": "1", "claim_type": "evaluation", "logos": "0", "pathos": "0", "evidence": "0", "relevance": "0", "ethos": "0", "concreteness": "0", "eloquence": "0"}]}]}]}

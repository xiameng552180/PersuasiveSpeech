{"Abortion-12": [{"op_claim": "I believe that the issue of abortion is in no way a womens rights issue, CMV.", "op_premise": "[\"First off Ill say now that Im mostly pro-choice. I dislike the idea of abortions done late in the pregnancy (and consequently believe that abortions should only be legal for the first few months) but theyre a rather small minority (and of the ones that are done Id imagine a fair number are for health reasons, which Im all for). Both sides have their zealots, and I guess this bothers me more so because I both agree with the core idea behind abortion, but the reasoning used by many pro-choice people strikes me as being rather stupid.\", \"The core of the abortion issue, I believe, is whether or not the fetus has rights. Everything else is just fluff meant to draw people in to either side as well as giving them an excuse to get angry (I remember seeing a thread in...atheism? I think that read something like how do christians justify their crusade against women? in regards to abortion and I couldnt help but roll my eyes.)\", \"If a fetus has the same rights as a person, surely a womens right to do what she wants with her body doesnt trump a fetus right to, you know, not get murdered. My right to swing my arm ends at your nose and all that, as well as the fact that the right to do what you etc. doesnt include killing other people with it (because duh). Why would that be different with regards to abortion?\", \"Ive seen people argue that the fetus doesnt have the right to occupy the womens body without her consent, but isnt the consent implied given that the women is at least partially (rape notwithstanding) responsible for putting it there in the first place? A fetus cannot, by its very nature, be held responsible for literally anything it does before birth, and consequently anything that it does is the fault/responsibility of the parents (more the mother than the father, but hey it does take 2 to get started)\", \"With that said, I genuinely believe that the idea of abortion as a womans rights issue is less about womens right itself than it is about giving pro-choicers something to get angry about (because one pissed off person who agrees with you is worth 50 calm/quiet ones as far as politics are concerned), and would love to have someone logically change that, since it does strike me as an easier stance to take that its a womens rights issue but alas I cant side with something I find logically wrong, even if it seems easier, so please

Not directly because theyre black, but because I dont find them attractive. I find plenty of other minorities attractive, and I have black friends (but lets face it, every closet racist says that)., I dont believe I am racist. Its not a conscious decision to find black people unattractive, I just do. I believe that I am not racist in the same way that a straight person is not sexist to find other members of the same sex unattractive., CMV!, Sorry if any of my terminology was non-PC.]", "reply-info": [{"replyer_name": "veggiesama", "reply_time": "6 years ago", "reply_delta_num": "42", "reply_votes": "2 points", "reply_contents": [{"content": "I get it", "is_claim": "0", "claim_type": "0", "logos": "0", "pathos": "0", "evidence": "0", "relevance": "0", "ethos": "0", "concreteness": "0", "eloquence": "0"}, {"content": " You dont drink it black", "is_claim": "0", "claim_type": "0", "logos": "1", "pathos": "0", "evidence": "0", "relevance": "0", "ethos": "0", "concreteness": "0", "eloquence": "0"}, {"content": " Perhaps you should ease in with a mocha or cappuccino, something dark but with a milky aftertaste", "is_claim": "0", "claim_type": "0", "logos": "1", "pathos": "0", "evidence": "0", "relevance": "0", "ethos": "0", "concreteness": "0", "eloquence": "0"}, {"content": "If its more of a cultural thing (you dont like the way they typically dress, act, or speak), there are plenty who grew up in mostly white suburban communities and who have adopted those subcultural mannerisms", "is_claim": "0", "claim_type": "0", "logos": "1", "pathos": "0", "evidence": "0", "relevance": "0", "ethos": "0", "concreteness": "0", "eloquence": "0"}, {"content": " If its a racial thing, like the skin, lips, bone structure, etc", "is_claim": "0", "claim_type": "0", "logos": "1", "pathos": "0", "evidence": "0", "relevance": "0", "ethos": "0", "concreteness": "0", "eloquence": "0"}, {"content": " I have to remind you that a whole spectrum of different facial and body types exist within the race and between races, and plenty of whites might suffer from the same problems you see as defining black features", "is_claim": "0", "claim_type": "0", "logos": "1", "pathos": "0", "evidence": "0", "relevance": "0", "ethos": "0", "concreteness": "0", "eloquence": "0"}, {"content": "I don\\t think it\\s racist to say Generally, I don\\t find blacks attractive", "is_claim": "1", "claim_type": "evaluation ", "logos": "0", "pathos": "0", "evidence": "0", "relevance": "0", "ethos": "0", "concreteness": "0", "eloquence": "0"}, {"content": " However, it\\s moving into unfair prejudice if you say I don\\t find blacks attractive, and I never will", "is_claim": "1", "claim_type": "evaluation", "logos": "0", "pathos": "0", "evidence": "0", "relevance": "0", "ethos": "0", "concreteness": "0", "eloquence": "0"}, {"content": " Whatever the case, I don\\t think either statement is racist because I don\\t think relationship discrimination should be considered a thing, else I could file lawsuits against every high school girl who laughed at my advances", "is_claim": "1", "claim_type": "evaluation", "logos": "0", "pathos": "0", "evidence": "0", "relevance": "0", "ethos": "0", "concreteness": "0", "eloquence": "0"}]}, {"replyer_name": "swearrengen", "reply_time": "6 years ago", "reply_delta_num": "135", "reply_votes": "17 points", "reply_contents": [{"content": "I believe that I am not a racist", "is_claim": "0", "claim_type": "0", "logos": "0", "pathos": "0", "evidence": "0", "relevance": "0", "ethos": "0", "concreteness": "0", "eloquence": "0"}, {"content": "Do you believe that your identity as an individual, your personality, beliefs, predispositions or behaviour -

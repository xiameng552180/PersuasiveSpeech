{"Marriage-50": [{"op_claim": "I believe that marriage is an outdated and oppressive tradition. CMV", "op_premise": "[I don\\t see any good reason why two (or more) people would bind themselves to this promise of til death do us part. First of all, obvious point - 50% of marriages end in divorce, so you know there\\s a good chance it won\\t work out. But even if you do make it work - at what cost, to your and your partner\\s happiness? I think that if you really do love each other, you will stick together for as long as that holds true, marriage or not. Marriage is a way of saying even if we start to absolutely hate each others guts, we\\re bound to each other like it or not. Why would you subject yourself to that potential torment? If it\\s not meant to be, it\\s not meant to be - let each other go. And are you so afraid that your partner will stop loving you and leave you for someone else, that you have to handcuff them to you with marriage? If your love for your partner is anything more than purely selfish, you should want your partner to be happy. So you should let them go if their happiness requires it. If the relationship goes sour, you should just be able to say okay we\\re done. Peace out. But if you\\re married, then you have to go through the whole messy divorce problem, after trying to make it work with marriage counseling for who knows how many years. Essentially, by getting married you earn yourself no advantages in your relationship, but you put yourself at risk for some serious unhappiness. I understand there may be certain legal benefits, but lets leave that aside, since no one cites tax write-offs as their primary reason for getting married., More generally, I believe that this romantic ideal of two people faithfully monogamous to each other for the rest of their lives is just pure Disney, and its causing more harm than good. So a lot of my criticism of marriage applies to monogamous relationships in general. We will continue to suffer from relationships - either staying in unhappy ones, or being devastated when a partner leaves or cheats on us - until we accept that both partners are free and independent human beings, and a good relationship is one that is enthusiastically engaged in on both sides. If for whatever reason one partner is unhappy with the relationship, then they should be free to leave it without any shame or guilt. They shouldnt feel like they have to hide their feelings, or go behind their partners back and cheat on them. I think its perfectly natural for a relationship to have its time, and run its course. By letting go of a bad relationship, you open yourself up to a better one.]", "reply-info": [{"replyer_name": "funchy", "reply_time": "6 years ago", "reply_delta_num": "19", "reply_votes": "1 point",

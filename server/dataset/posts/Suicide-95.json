If someone decides things will not get better, that's their call, and staying alive because of guilt or obligation to other people hardly seems a solution.\", \"I just don't think someone killing themselves should be seen as shameful, and the stigma attached to it that only mentally unbalanced people would consider it seems unfair.\", \"My view is no-doubt effected by my Atheism and the fact that I lost a friend to suicide several years ago, but I just don't see it as some dark, horrendous thing that society should keep hidden and stigmatised. I'm talking about assisted suicide (which here in the UK is illegal) as well.

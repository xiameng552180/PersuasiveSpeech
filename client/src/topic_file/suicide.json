There are also many replies regarding \"making meaning.\" To me (unless someone wants to expand and show me otherwise) this is a kind of vague platitude that doesn\\'t carry much weight.', 'However, a couple of comments have led to this modification/clarification: I suppose my view leads me to death rather than various types of activities some have listed (kids, fishing in Alaska, traveling the world, etc.) because fundamentally I have never been meaningfully happy enough to make it worthwhile. To me sarcasm24 got it right with \"being dead would be just as meaningless, but would also avoid all the toil that goes into a life that is, ultimately, meaningless.\" I recognize that this is a point where others might say I need medication or a new outlook or some change that might make me happy. But to me it seems like virtually all lives will end up falling into the category sarcasm24 is laying out.', 'EDIT 2: Wow, lots of great responses here. Thanks for a constructive dialogue! I have a lot of work to get done this morning but I intend to go through all the replies here more thoroughly this afternoon. I really appreciate all the responses and am excited to read through them :)', \"EDIT 3: Some closing thoughts on this thread..I suppose my argument makes little sense if you could be happy enough. Meaninglessness may still be a problem, but suicide is only a solution if being alive is in some way difficult or upsetting. That said, it's too easy to dismiss this as something that can be fixed through medication (if you're depressed), pursuing your dreams, having good friends and good hobbies, etc.. I am still left feeling that most people on planet earth will never attain a level of happiness that makes life the better option.\", \"Life is hard for almost everyone. And to me it's hard enough (again, for almost everyone) that suicide doesn't seem like an inherently poor choice. But this is very subjective. If you think you are having a good enough time, I hope you all continue to do so and continue to enjoy life!\", 'Personally, I think I will use the next couple years to pursue some of the suggestions of this thread (meditation, completely new activities, maybe a psychedelic, etc.). Hope that I can report back to this thread in a year or two and tell you that you all changed my view.",

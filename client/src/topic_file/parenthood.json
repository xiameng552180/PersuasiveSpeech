Haha not to the point where I don't want children anymore (actually I'm planning on having at least one more) but I can appreciate where childfree people are coming from.\", \"I understand now why people say they want to spend all their time/money on themselves. Thinking about it now, most of my time is spent on my daughter. There isn't much time for me and my husband, and whilst we don't mind, I understand why others would.\", \"I've read some responses here where people talk about just not liking children at all. I'll be honest, that concept is still very foreign to me. I have a very strong maternal instinct so I guess I won't ever be able to understand how someone could pick up a cute baby and not like it.\", \"Also, the argument about oveepopulation. Obviously having like 5 children isn't exactly being responsible but I don't think having 1 or 2 will kill the environment/ suck up all resources.\", 'I finally understand now so thank you for all your responses.', \"As the title states, I don't understand why people don't want to have children. I have a 6 month old daughter of my own, and whilst it's hard work, I've never felt happier and more complete. All of my friends who have children say the same thing.\", \"I know some people childless by choice, and I don't judge them or think they are selfish at all. I just don't understand why they don't want to have a little cherub of their own.\", \"Im Jewish, and it's always been instilled in us that it's pretty much required to have children, so I believe that's why I think this way.\", 'So please, change my view! :)",

It is the job of educators, parents, governments, and other authority figures to beat the shit out of your inner child, so they can turn you into a mindless zombie who acts out some absurd idea of \"this is what an adult is supposed to do.\" ",
        "op_premise": "Why are children so joyful and carefree, while adults are often such miserable sacks of anxiety, depression, or some other form of psychosis? I believe that decades of learned repression are responsible. It all starts in the classroom with \"Sit down Johnny, stop throwing that pencil at Suzy!\" But after being told over and over that acting on your desires is unacceptable, you need to shut up and do your work, you learn to repress those desires. \"Yes, yes, I do really want to do this work. I want to get this A.\" In a sense, you learn to create in your mind a little teacher that is yelling at you to stop being an immature brat and instead be \"responsible.\" \"Growing up\" is the process of fully identifying with that little teacher you\\'ve created, so that you do the \"responsible\" thing without the need for an actual teacher threatening to send you to the Principle\\'s office.', 'Your conception of what it means to be an adult is not purely determined by teachers and parents either - this is bigger than that. It\\'s also your culture (or subculture): how as a man/woman you are \"supposed\" to behave, or what is cool/uncool, for example. I believe that kind of pressure is equally (or more) powerful, and it also serves to repress your natural childlike state. We could say that in addition to the little teacher you created in your mind, you create an equivalent figure for the group of peers you\\'re trying to fit into, and it yells at you whenever you do something uncool.', \"Ground between these two rocks, authority and peer pressure, I believe that little is left of your inner child by age 20 or so. Its kind of still there, but it's been badly abused, shoved into the basement and chained to the wall. Many people have forgotten its even there. They're too busy trying to act out some script that was given to them, that really has nothing to do with who they truly are. Who doesn't want to be accepted? If anything, that's the only part of the inner child still left intact: this desperate desire to fit in. No one represses that desire, because it is so essential for being a zombie.\", \"Yes, you have to learn how to be responsible and how to interact with your peers. You have to learn how to function in the adult world. But is functioning living? I'd argue that you can only truly live by being in touch with your authentic desires, by stubbornly insisting on your right to be a child - that is, to be a natural development of the person you were when you were a child. This is probably one of the most difficult things you can attempt - a zombified adult insists that everyone around him be a zombie as well, so most likely you will have to go around pretending you are a zombie too most of the time. The only way to make this bearable is if you find some non-zombie companions, around whom you are free to be your true, 100% self around.\", 'I welcome any challenge to my viewpoint.",

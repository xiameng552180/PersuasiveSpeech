It opened my eyes to the fact that I really didnt give two shits if these people wanted to get married. They seemed like normal people who just preferred something different to me. I see that kind of thing everyday., I quite literally equated it to choosing between a mustard hot dog or a ketchup hot dog., Its a pretty simple justification, really., Im open to having my views changed if the arguments are thorough and logical enough.]",

        "op_premise": "[I don\\t see any good reason why two (or more) people would bind themselves to this promise of til death do us part. First of all, obvious point - 50% of marriages end in divorce, so you know there\\s a good chance it won\\t work out. But even if you do make it work - at what cost, to your and your partner\\s happiness? I think that if you really do love each other, you will stick together for as long as that holds true, marriage or not. Marriage is a way of saying even if we start to absolutely hate each others guts, we\\re bound to each other like it or not. Why would you subject yourself to that potential torment? If it\\s not meant to be, it\\s not meant to be - let each other go. And are you so afraid that your partner will stop loving you and leave you for someone else, that you have to handcuff them to you with marriage? If your love for your partner is anything more than purely selfish, you should want your partner to be happy. So you should let them go if their happiness requires it. If the relationship goes sour, you should just be able to say okay we\\re done. Peace out. But if you\\re married, then you have to go through the whole messy divorce problem, after trying to make it work with marriage counseling for who knows how many years. Essentially, by getting married you earn yourself no advantages in your relationship, but you put yourself at risk for some serious unhappiness. I understand there may be certain legal benefits, but lets leave that aside, since no one cites tax write-offs as their primary reason for getting married., More generally, I believe that this romantic ideal of two people faithfully monogamous to each other for the rest of their lives is just pure Disney, and its causing more harm than good. So a lot of my criticism of marriage applies to monogamous relationships in general. We will continue to suffer from relationships - either staying in unhappy ones, or being devastated when a partner leaves or cheats on us - until we accept that both partners are free and independent human beings, and a good relationship is one that is enthusiastically engaged in on both sides. If for whatever reason one partner is unhappy with the relationship, then they should be free to leave it without any shame or guilt. They shouldnt feel like they have to hide their feelings, or go behind their partners back and cheat on them. I think its perfectly natural for a relationship to have its time, and run its course. By letting go of a bad relationship, you open yourself up to a better one.]",

        "op_premise": "[When it comes down to marriage I think compatibility is key. In my experience when youre living with someone intimately, having the same or similar religious beliefs is immensely important. Because I believe that deep down they will always hope for you to convert and probably thinking you will see the light someday. The atheist will also hope deep down that they will lose their faith as well. Having this kind of thinking will make it irksome for both parties in the long run. In the event of an heated argument you can bet their faith or lack of to be brought up as an innate fault within themselves., In the end it will always be a nagging feeling because they will want to become one with each other and thats impossible when two people share different beliefs on something crucial to peoples lives as religion. That nagging feeling will naturally grow into contempt and tear the marriage apart., Edit: Let me be frank Im an American and I know little to zilch about how other countries handle religion, which could be my inherent failure of understanding some of the viewpoints you guys posted. Examples of working couples that have managed this can help. Because I never in my life have seen it and always felt a great deal of animosity for being an atheist in my life., To make some clarifications Im not talking about fundamentalist or militant atheist believe or not there is really a middle in between those two extremes. Big beliefs like religion which is large part of someones thinking and world view cannot be easily accepted by someone who does share similar beliefs., To specify Im only talking about religions such as Christianity, Islam, and Jadaism. Basically religions that take a big part of someones life and a major part of their worldview., Double edit: My original baseless assertion that it was impossible to have a good marriage was, admittedly, stupid. My view has changed.]",

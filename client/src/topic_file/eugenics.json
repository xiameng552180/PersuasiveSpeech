The world would be more peaceful and a much better place to live than it is today. Movies like Gattaca show a possibility of having superior being living alongside inferior but I think that natural birth should become illegal and babies can only be created using eugenics. I know this would be hard to do but families should really think before having natural birth when Eugenics is available considering their child would have a much lesser life. Eventually I think that the world would only exist of superior beings capable of solving many crisis' and protecting our race.\"]",

I was born with transposition of the great arteries, and while my quality of life has generally been fair, I also consider the heartbreak this has caused my parents and myself. While it's not been fully determined if it's a genetic condition or simply a mutation that occurs in-utero, if given the choice, I wouldn't wish this upon anyone else.\", \"Science has made remarkable strides in breaking down the genetic code of humans and the maladies the effect us. They can tell us if we carry certain genetic markers for breast cancer (Angelina Jolie recently had a double mastectomy because she tested positive for it), Alzheimer's, and many more.\", \"I don't believe that eugenics should be employed for desirable traits like skin/eye/hair colour, height, etc. But I do believe that if we can prevent the suffering of millions of people, that eugenics is a positive thing, and should be seriously considered as a viable public healthcare initiative.\", 'For the record: I live in Canada (if it matters)', \"Edit 1: If eugenics were to be employed, it would be highly regulated, and only specific genetic markers would be sought. Determining if someone was a risk taker, or had a likelihood of an illness that is manageable and doesn't effect the overall quality of life would not be checked unless specifically requested by the parent.

I would argue that this should be paid for by your insurance. No one would have access to the records (other than the parents), so insurance companies can't refuse to cover you because you carry a certain gene.\", \"Edit 2: The government cannot force you to have genetic testing, but they should pay for it if you wish to have it done. They can't compel you to destroy embryos or have an abortion if the embryo/fetus tests positive for something. No one but the parents would know the results.\", \"Edit 3: I started to change what I was trying to say by making it more PC, but then I realized that I was making addendum's that I really didn't believe in.

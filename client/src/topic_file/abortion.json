      "op_premise": "[Hello their! I am a 15 year old, agnostic male. I went to a private middle and high school, and every year we learned about abortion., I first though abortion was a womans choice, that she can choice to bring a child into this life or not. But, I heard a great argument against this., The argument is known as the SLED argument., Their are only 4 things different from a unborn baby, and a human. These four things are Size, Level of development, environment, and dependency., Is it ok to kill a child, because it is smaller than you?, Is it ok to kill a baby because it dependns on you?, Is it ok to kill someone in a different envioment?, And is it ok to kill someone that is dependent on others?, Now, I know this is a opposing view from the majoirty of the people here. I wonder why people are so ok with just killing someone that hasent had a choice themselves. The child cant choose for themselves., In cases of rape, abortion is still wrong. Why should the child pay for another persons crime?, The only case that abortion is \"ok\" is when both the baby and mother will die in childbirth., CMV., Edit: wow, this blew up. My view has been changed, I never thought that I would see it this way., Thanks all!]",

If you wish to use some version of the argument, explain to me why the latter right trumps the former. For those unfamiliar with the argument:\", http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Defense_of_Abortion, \"Thank you for participating. This is basically the only issue where I part ways with my fellow progressives, and I would like to see r/changemyviews take.\", Edit: A third element I failed to include that is present in \"A Defense of Abortion\". Although the fetus may only be a clump of non-sentient cells, there is a fundamental difference between it and an amoeba or tree leaf cell: it\\s in the process of becoming sentient unless we actively move to stop it. So I view it as akin to someone who does have brain damage or something equivalent, but is improving and will be aware in nine months. Just like I think it would be murder to take that person off life support, the same applies in the case of a fetus. Here\\s the appropriate portion from \"A Defense of Abortion\":, \"<You wake up in the morning and find yourself back to back in bed with an unconscious violinist. A famous unconscious violinist. He has been found to have a fatal kidney ailment, and the Society of Music Lovers has canvassed all the available medical records and found that you alone have the right blood type to help. They have therefore kidnapped you, and last night the violinists circulatory system was plugged into yours, so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own. [If he is unplugged from you now, he will die; but] in nine months he will have recovered from his ailment, and can safely be unplugged from you.>\"]",

In the future, this woman would therefore make a different choice if faced with an unwanted pregnancy. But the key element there is the choice. The womans ability to choose in the past allowed her to escape a difficult or impossible situation. If she made that choice in the past, she can more easlity understand why that same option would be necesarry for another woman. I disagree that she could now justifiably oppose another womans right to make the same choice that she did, especially if she herself benefitted from that same ability to choose. It seems to me that people holding this view only want women to have a choice concerning their body if they themselves are in need of having that option. I see it as taking advantage of the ability to choose, but once that choice is no longer seen as needed, not allowing anyone else to have it. It seems a bit selfish, IMO.\", \"I do not mean for this post to start a pro/anti-choice debate, simply a discussion over whether this attitude is justifiable. I really would like to be able to understand and respect these individuals opinions. Help me see what they see and CMV.\", \"EDIT: Thank you, people of CMV! Im now realizing how ignorant I had been of all the reasons a person could change their feelings on the issue, as well as the varied opinions that could result.\"]",

I dislike the idea of abortions done late in the pregnancy (and consequently believe that abortions should only be legal for the first few months) but theyre a rather small minority (and of the ones that are done Id imagine a fair number are for health reasons, which Im all for). Both sides have their zealots, and I guess this bothers me more so because I both agree with the core idea behind abortion, but the reasoning used by many pro-choice people strikes me as being rather stupid.\", \"The core of the abortion issue, I believe, is whether or not the fetus has rights. Everything else is just fluff meant to draw people in to either side as well as giving them an excuse to get angry (I remember seeing a thread in...atheism? I think that read something like how do christians justify their crusade against women? in regards to abortion and I couldnt help but roll my eyes.)\", \"If a fetus has the same rights as a person, surely a womens right to do what she wants with her body doesnt trump a fetus right to, you know, not get murdered. My right to swing my arm ends at your nose and all that, as well as the fact that the right to do what you etc. doesnt include killing other people with it (because duh). Why would that be different with regards to abortion?\", \"Ive seen people argue that the fetus doesnt have the right to occupy the womens body without her consent, but isnt the consent implied given that the women is at least partially (rape notwithstanding) responsible for putting it there in the first place? A fetus cannot, by its very nature, be held responsible for literally anything it does before birth, and consequently anything that it does is the fault/responsibility of the parents (more the mother than the father, but hey it does take 2 to get started)\", \"With that said, I genuinely believe that the idea of abortion as a womans rights issue is less about womens right itself than it is about giving pro-choicers something to get angry about (because one pissed off person who agrees with you is worth 50 calm/quiet ones as far as politics are concerned), and would love to have someone logically change that, since it does strike me as an easier stance to take that its a womens rights issue but alas I cant side with something I find logically wrong, even if it seems easier, so please CMV.\"]",

Its their body they should be in control of their health.\", Therefore, i believe that all this talk about \"women\\s rights\" really misses the point. Both sides should be defending why/why not, at a certain point in gestation, a fetus does or does not have rights. Simply saying \"its the woman\\s body she should be able to do what she wants\" does not acknowledge the fact that at some point the rights of the fetus needs to be taken into account. And where that point is, is actually the crux of the debate., \"Note: Im very pro womens health, and womens rights. I just believe that the debate isnt really a matter of womens rights, its a matter of at what point does the fetus have rights.\", \"Edit: Im talking about elective abortion\"]",
